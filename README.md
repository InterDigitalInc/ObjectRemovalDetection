# ObjectRemovalDetection

ObjectRemovalDetection is C++ library used to detect the changes that occurred
in a scene between an outdated 3D mesh of said-scene and a sequence of
up-to-date images. Particular attention is paid to the detection of object
removals.

## Installation

ObjectRemovalDetection expends on the work conducted by E. Palazzolo
at https://github.com/PRBonn/fast_change_detection. Download said project and
extract it into a `workfolder` and install the dependencies. If you are running
the library on windows, you do not need to install `catkin`. `Qt` is not
required by ObjectRemovalDetection.

To install and use ObjectRemovalDetection, download the project and extract it
into the same `workfolder` (replacing the headers and adding new source files).

Replace the existing `CMakeLists.txt` by either `CMakeLists-ubuntu.txt` or
`CMakeLists-windows.txt`. On Ubuntu, the installation procedure is the same as
https://github.com/PRBonn/fast_change_detection. On Windows you must edit the
`CMakeLists.txt` to find the dependencies and run the following commands:

```bash
cd workfolder
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```

And then build the Visual Studio solution generated by cmake.

## Usage

### Datasets

E. Palazzolo's dataset is downloadable at http://www.ipb.uni-bonn.de/html/projects/changedetection2017/changedetection2017.zip

The ScanNet dataset is 3rd Party Data. Restrictions apply to the availability of
these data. Data was obtained from Stanford University and Princeton University
and are available https://github.com/ScanNet/ScanNet with the permission of
Stanford University and Princeton University.

### Examples

The `DATASET_PATH` work folder's contents must follow the conventions of E.
Palazzolo's dataset. It should contain:
* a `model.obj` file for the outdated mesh
* an `images` folder with `Image*.JPG` files for the up-to-date image sequence
* a `cameras.xml` file that contain the camera's intrisincs and the images' poses

Usage:
```bash
./change_detection[_shaders] DATASET_PATH [kernel_size] [max_comparisons] [rescale_width] [threshold_change_area] [threshold_change_value]
```

`kernel_size` is the windows size for the median filter used, 3 by default.

`max_comparisons` is the number of images in the sequence minus 1, 4 by default.

`rescale_width` is the width chosen to process the images, 500 by default, -1
keeps the images in their original size.

`threshold_change_area` is the area threshold under which 2D changes are
discarded, 50 by default (should be coherent with `rescale_width`).

`threshold_change_value` is the pixel value (1-255) threshold under which 2D
changes are discarded, -1 by default to use the automatic triangle threshold.

The `change_detection_shaders` example uses shaders instead of CPU code, only
for insertion detection.
