# ObjectRemovalDetection

ObjectRemovalDetection is C++ library used to detect the changes that occurred
in a scene between an outdated 3D mesh of said-scene and a sequence of
up-to-date images. Particular attention is paid to the detection of object
removals.

## Installation

ObjectRemovalDetection expends on the work conducted by E. Palazzolo
at https://github.com/PRBonn/fast_change_detection. Download said project and
extract it into a `workfolder` and install the dependencies. If you are running
the library on windows, you do not need to install `catkin`. `Qt` is not
required by ObjectRemovalDetection.

To install and use ObjectRemovalDetection, download the project and extract it
into the same `workfolder` (replacing the headers and adding new source files).

Replace the existing `CMakeLists.txt` by either `CMakeLists-ubuntu.txt` or
`CMakeLists-windows.txt`. On Ubuntu, the installation procedure is the same as
https://github.com/PRBonn/fast_change_detection. On Windows you must edit the
`CMakeLists.txt` to find the dependencies and run the following commands:

```bash
cd workfolder
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```

And then build the Visual Studio solution generated by cmake.
